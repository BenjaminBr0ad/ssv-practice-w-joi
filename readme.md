# Server Side Validation w/ Joi

# Instructions
1. The project, as is, includes handwritten back-end validation.
2. This means that this is an appropriate way to handle back-end validation -- that is, using if/else statements and multiple res.status.send commands to send the correct error message for particular cases.
3. However, Joi and Express-Validation can automate a lot of this validation and can be especially helpful for situations in which you must validate more complex fields.
4. Attempt to re-factor the code to use Joi and Express-Validation so that less if/else statements are needed to retrieve the error messages generated by Joi.
